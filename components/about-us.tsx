                Craftsmanship Meets Innovation

              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                As a solo contractor with a passion for metalworking, I&apos;ve
                taken my craft to the next level by designing and building my
                own CNC plasma cutter. This unique approach allows me to offer
                unmatched precision and customization in every project I
                undertake.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                My journey began with a vision to create something extraordinary
                â€“ not just metal parts, but precisely crafted solutions for my
                clients&apos; needs. By building my own CNC machine, I gained
                intimate knowledge of every aspect of the cutting process,
                ensuring the highest quality results for every project.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Whether you need custom parts, artistic metalwork, or industrial
                components, you&apos;re working directly with the craftsman who
                built the machine that will bring your vision to life.
